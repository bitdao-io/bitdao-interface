# [What is BitDAO? What is its purpose?](#purpose)

BitDAO is a protocol governed by BIT token holders. BitDAO will use its significant financial resources to improve innovation, collaboration and growth across the DeFi space.

If you want to dive into details check out the docs.

# What is a DAO and why does BitDAO use this structure?

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a structure used by many DeFi and crypto projects as a governance process. Decentralized — as there will be many different holders of the BIT token across the global. Autonomous — as any action successfully voted in by the DAO will be automatically executed on-chain.

As with many DAOs, BitDAO gives token holders full power to make changes to the protocol, including transferring assets, editing the protocol rules, and upgrading the protocol.

# Who controls BitDAO?

BitDAO is controlled by BIT tokens, with each BIT token having equal voting power.

# What is BIT?

# How do I participate in BitDAO?

We are inviting the community to collaborate: be a contributor, partner, holder, voter.

**Contributor** - for non-token holders can participate in our forum, social media, share ideas. Good ideas may be adopted by token holders or delegated votes for proposal.

**Partner** - we are looking to work with any DeFi or CeFi project who can contribute or look to grow with the BitDAO  ecosystem. This can be integration of communities and protocols.

Holder talking points - growth of partners, BitDAO protocol upgrades and DeFi products…

**Voter** -
