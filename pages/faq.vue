# What is BitDAO? What is its purpose?

BitDAO is a protocol governed by BIT token holders. BitDAO will use its significant financial resources to improve innovation, collaboration and growth across the DeFi space.

# What is a DAO and why does BitDAO use this structure?

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a structure used by many DeFi and crypto projects as a governance process. Decentralized — as there will be many different holders of the BIT token across the global. Autonomous — as any action successfully voted in by the DAO will be automatically executed on-chain.

As with many DAOs, BitDAO gives token holders full power to make changes to the protocol, including transferring assets, editing the protocol rules, and upgrading the protocol.
